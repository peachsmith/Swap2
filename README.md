# Swap2
## What is Swap?
A solution without a problem
## Basic Syntax
    import "io";
    
    writeln("Hello, World!");
    
    struct Stuff {
        d;
    }
    
    s = new Stuff;
    s.d = 4;
    
    function blat(stuff) {
        if (typeof(stuff) != "struct") {
            writeln(stuff.d);
        }
    }
    
## Why the 2?
The first attempt at making Swap didn't go so well, but the repository still exists.
